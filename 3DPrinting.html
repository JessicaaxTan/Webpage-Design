            <h2>3D Printing</h2>
            <p class="par">3D Printing is a process of making a physical object from a three-dimensional digital model. It brings digital CAD representation into physical form. 3D printing has gone beyond being an industrial prototyping and manufacturing process as it has become accessible to almost everyone. Main areas of use would be prototyping, specialised parts ( biomedical engineering, dental and aerospace) and hobbies. 3D Printing uses software that slices the 3D model into layers (0.01mm thick or less). Each layer is then traced onto the build plate by the printer. Once a layer is completed, the build plate is lowered and the next layer is added on top of the previous one. </p>
            <p class="par">There are 2 types of manufacturing techniques; ‘Additive manufacturing’ and ‘Subtractive Manufacturing’. 3D printing is known for ‘Additive manufacturing’. </p>
            <p class="par"><strong><font color= #ff7200>‘Additive manufacturing’</font></strong> is a method of adding material in successive patterns to create the desired shape of a part.</p>
            <p class="par"><strong><font color= #ff7200>‘Subtractive Manufacturing’</font></strong> is the process of removing material from a preformed block. E.g. Milling and Cutting. This method creates a lot of waste as the cut-off materials are mostly scraps. </p>

            <p class="par">The extruder motor would rotate towards each other so that the filament would slide into the nozzle. The nozzle would then melt the filament while creating each layer on the printer bed.</p>

            <h4 class="par">Types of Filament</h4>
            <p class="par">Most common 3D printing filament used would be PLA, ABS and PET-G. PLA is a type of polyester made from fermented plant starch from corn, cassava, maize, sugarcane or sugar beet pulp. ABS is an opaque thermoplastic. PET-G is a thermoplastic polyester.</p>
            <img src="filament.jpg" style="padding-left: 20px;margin-top: 0%;width:870px;height:250px;" >
            <p class="par">In summary, PLA is a low to medium strength filament given its low heat and chemical resistance. ABS is a medium to high strength filament as it will bend sooner than break. It also has a higher impact, heat, and chemical resistance than PLA. PETG is a medium to high strength filament.</p>

            <p class="par">Cura is an open source slicing application for 3D printers. Slicing 3D models means taking your design (.stl format) and slicing it into individual layers. The software then generates the tool path (.gcode) the printer will use for printing. Most slicing softwares will have a print preview function to help prevent print failures.</p>

            <p class="par">4. I am changing the size of my Knight chess piece.</p>
            <p class="par">5. Set the layer height: 0.15, infill: 10%, support and adhesion. Layer height is the height of each layer. The shorter the height, the better the print. Infill means how filled the print would be. Supports are used to support parts of the 3D printed model when printing. They are easily removable. Adhesion is an additional larger base on the 3D printed model so that it will not shift/tilt when printing. Click <strong><font color= #ff7200>Slice</font></strong> when done.</p>
            <p class="par">6. Go to <strong><font color= #ff7200>PREVIEW</font></strong> to view how the final 3D model would look like.</p>

            <p class="par">When done printing, wait for the model to cool down till 45 degree celcius before removing. This is because when the model is still hot, it is able to bend easily. Using pliers/wire cutters, remove the support and adhesion from the model and we are done!</p>

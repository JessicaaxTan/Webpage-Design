            <p class="par">Safety Certification is a requirement for all students as Singapore Polytechnic has a legal responsibility under the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Act 2006 to ensure a safe working environment. Students who pass the assessment will be certified and allowed to attend skill training and work in the workshop and Fab Lab. Failures must sit for re-test. To ensure that all students are given appropriate safety and health training related to their field of study.</p>

            <embed src="Section3.pdf" type="application/pdf" />
            <h4 class="par">Mechanical Hazards: </h4>
            <p class="par">1. <strong>Entanglement Hazards</strong> - Entanglement arise when loose clothing, hair, or loose item gets caught with the moving parts of a machine.</p>
            <p class="par">2. <strong>Cutting Hazards</strong> - Cutting hazards are present in machines used to cut wood, metal or other materials at the point of operation. Machines with moving cutting elements are dangerous. They can cause severe injury (eg. deep cuts, amputations) due to its own momentum when they come into contact with a worker’s body.</p>
            <p class="par">3. <strong>Impact Hazards</strong> - Impact hazards relate to objects that strike the human body, but do not penetrate it. The severity of an impact hazard depends on the speed, force and inertia of the moving machine part during operation or upon ejection from the machine.</p>
            <p class="par">4. <strong>Shearing Hazards</strong> - Parts of the machine that moves past each other or stationary objects, can cause a shear point. Resulting in a crushing or cutting action. In general, shearing hazards are present between two machine parts, such as power press punch, shearing machine, etc.</p>
            <p class="par">5. <strong>Crushing Hazards</strong> - It is caused when part of the body is caught between either two moving parts of machinery or a moving part and a stationary object.</p>
            <p class="par">6. <strong>Draw-in Hazards</strong> - Injuries can occur when a body part is drawn-in by in running nip points formed by two counter-rotating parts or between rotating and tangentially moving surfaces.</p>
            <p class="par">7. <strong>Friction and Abrasion Hazards</strong> - Friction burns and abrasions occurs when encountering rough surfaces moving at high speed e.g. sanding machine, grinding wheel etc. can cause abrasion injuries.</p>
            <span style = "padding-left: 40px;"></span>
            
            <h4 class="par">Non-Mechanical Hazards: </h4>
            <p class="par">1. <strong>Fall from Heights Hazards</strong> - When required to work at heights, fall can lead to sprains or broken bones and in more serious cases, head injuries or even death.</p>
            <p class="par">2. <strong>Noise Hazards</strong> - Entanglement arise when loose clothing, hair, or loose item gets caught with the moving parts of a machine.</p>
            <p class="par">3. <strong>Entanglement Hazards</strong> - Noise is often generated during machine operations and work activities. Prolonged exposure to excessive noise can cause NID( Noise-Induced Deafness ). To prevent hearing loss, one should not be exposed to noise levels exceeding 85 dB (A) for 8 hours a day.</p>
            <p class="par">4. <strong>Electrical Hazards</strong> - Worker may be exposed to electrical hazards, for e.g., during electrical installations or when machines or power tools are in use. Accidents involving contact with electricity can happen when an electrical machine failed, electric circuits are overloaded or shortcircuited, or when one comes into contact with a live wire.</p>
            <p class="par">5. <strong>Heat-related Hazards</strong> - Contact with hot surfaces of machines can cause severe skin burns. Operations involving high temperatures, high humidity or strenuous physical activities cause heat-related illness (e.g. heat exhaustion or in severe cases, heat stroke).</p>
            <p class="par">6. <strong>Chemical Hazards</strong> - Exposure to chemicals in the workplace can cause acute or long-term detrimental health effects.</p>
            <p class="par">7. <strong>Fatigue</strong> - Fatigue is tiredness leading to reduced mental and physical performance that can endanger safety and health. It can also lead to near-miss incidents, serious injuries and even fatal accidents due to reduced concentration and alertness. Long working hours without rest, intense and sustained physical exertion or mental effort, lack of adequate rest and sleep could be the causes of fatigue.</p>
            <p class="par">6. <strong>Ergonomic Risk Factors</strong> -  Workplace situations that cause wear and tear on the body that will can potentially result injury. These include repetition, awkward posture, forceful motion, stationary position, direct pressure, vibration, extreme temperature, noise, and work stress.</p>

            <h4 class="par">Types of Guards: </h4>
            <p class="par">1. <strong>Fixed Guards</strong> - Stationary (immovable) barriers that are usually firmly fastened in place, making it difficult to remove them.</p>
            <p class="par">2. <strong>Adjustable Guards</strong> - Movable, allowing thems to be used in many situations; particularly around point of operation.</p>
            <p class="par">3. <strong>Self-Adjusting Guards</strong> - Automatically moves as materials enter or move through the machine and do not require constant re-positioning.</p>
            <h4 class="par">Safety Devices: </h4>
            <p class="par">1. <strong>Pressure-Sensitive Trips</strong> - Wires or cables attached to switches. If a worker touches the cable, the switch "trips" and stops the machine.</p>
            <p class="par">2. <strong>Pressure Sensitive Mats</strong> - Machine shuts down when a worker steps on them.</p>
            <p class="par">3. <strong>Pressure Tripping Pedal on a Lathe</strong> - Located at the bottom of the machine. A worker need to manually step on the pedal. </p>
            <p class="par">4. <strong>Emergency Switch</strong> - A red button located at the top of the machine. A worker need to manually push the button.</p>
            
            <h3 class="par"><strong>Safe use of Hand & Power Tools : </strong> </h3>
            <embed src="Section%205.pdf" type="application/pdf" />
            <p class="par">It is important to handle tools with cautious, to eliminate potential injuries to our hands. Good housekeeping is required to eliminate hazards as well as providing a safe working environment for us and others to easily access various tools or places.</p>

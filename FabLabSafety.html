            <p class="par">Safety Certification is a requirement for all students as Singapore Polytechnic has a legal responsibility under the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Act 2006 to ensure a safe working environment. Students who pass the assessment will be certified and are allowed to attend skill training, as well as working in the workshop and FabLab. Failures must sit for re-test, to ensure that all students are given appropriate safety and health training.</p>

            <h4 class="par">Mechanical Hazards: </h4>
            <p class="par">1. <strong><font color= #ff7200>Entanglement Hazards</font></strong> - Entanglement arise when loose clothing, hair, or loose item gets caught with the moving parts of a machine.</p>
            <p class="par">2. <strong><font color= #ff7200>Cutting Hazards</font></strong> - Cutting hazards are present in machines used to cut wood, metal or other materials at the point of operation. Machines with moving cutting elements are dangerous. They can cause severe injury (eg. deep cuts, amputations) due to its own momentum when they come into contact with a worker’s body.</p>
            <p class="par">3. <strong><font color= #ff7200>Impact Hazards</font></strong> - Impact hazards relate to objects that strike the human body, but do not penetrate it. The severity of an impact hazard depends on the speed, force and inertia of the moving machine part during operation or upon ejection from the machine.</p>
            <p class="par">4. <strong><font color= #ff7200>Shearing Hazards</font></strong> - Parts of the machine that moves past each other or stationary objects, can cause a shear point. Resulting in a crushing or cutting action. In general, shearing hazards are present between two machine parts, such as power press punch, shearing machine, etc.</p>
            <p class="par">5. <strong><font color= #ff7200>Crushing Hazards</font></strong> - It is caused when part of the body is caught between either two moving parts of machinery or a moving part and a stationary object.</p>
            <p class="par">6. <strong><font color= #ff7200>Draw-in Hazards</font></strong> - Injuries can occur when a body part is drawn-in by in running nip points formed by two counter-rotating parts or between rotating and tangentially moving surfaces.</p>
            <p class="par">7. <strong><font color= #ff7200>Friction and Abrasion Hazards</font></strong> - Friction burns and abrasions occurs when encountering rough surfaces moving at high speed e.g. sanding machine, grinding wheel etc. can cause abrasion injuries.</p>
            <span style = "padding-left: 40px;"></span>
            
            <h4 class="par">Non-Mechanical Hazards: </h4>
            <p class="par">1. <strong><font color= #ff7200>Fall from Heights Hazards</font></strong> - When working with heights, falling can lead to sprains/broken bones. In more serious cases, head injuries or even death.</p>
            <p class="par">2. <strong><font color= #ff7200>Noise Hazards</font></strong> - Noise is often generated during machine operations and work activities. Prolonged exposure to excessive noise can cause NID( Noise-Induced Deafness ). To prevent hearing loss, one should not be exposed to noise levels exceeding 85 dB (A) for 8 hours a day.</p>
            <p class="par">3. <strong><font color= #ff7200>Electrical Hazards</font></strong> - Workers may be exposed to electrical hazards. E.g., during electrical installations or when power tools are in use. Accidents involving contact with electricity can happen when an electrical machine fails, electric circuits overloaded or shortcircuited, or when in contact with a live wire.</p>
            <p class="par">4. <strong><font color= #ff7200>Heat-related Hazards</font></strong> - Contact with hot surfaces of machines can cause severe skin burns. Operations involving high temperatures, high humidity or strenuous physical activities, can cause heat-related illness E.g. heat exhaustion or heat stroke.</p>
            <p class="par">5. <strong><font color= #ff7200>Chemical Hazards</font></strong> - Exposure to chemicals in workplaces can cause acute or long-term detrimental health effects.</p>
            <p class="par">6. <strong><font color= #ff7200>Fatigue</font></strong> - Fatigue is tiredness leading to reduced mental and physical performance that can endanger safety and health. It can also lead to near-miss incidents, serious injuries and even fatal accidents due to reduced concentration and alertness. Long working hours without rest, intense and sustained physical exertion or mental effort, lack of adequate rest and sleep could be the causes of fatigue.</p>
            <p class="par">7. <strong><font color= #ff7200>Ergonomic Risk Factors</font></strong> -  Workplace situations that causes wear and tear on the body can potentially result in injury. These includes repetition, awkward posture, forceful motion, stationary position, direct pressure, vibration, extreme temperature, noise, and work stress.</p>
